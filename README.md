## What is this repository?

This repository is a fork of HashiCorp's Consul repository, created so that Bloomberg's
engineering team can collaborate with each other (and the rest of the Consul community)
on enhancements to Consul. Branches in this repository represent 'work in progress' that
will be contributed to the HashiCorp Consul repository when the work is ready for review.

If you have any questions about the branches in this repository, feel free to open an issue
so our team can discuss them with you.
